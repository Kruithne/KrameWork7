## KrameWork7 - PHP7 Web Framework (WIP)

### What is this?
For a long time, sites I developed would be based on [KrameWork](https://github.com/Kruithne/KrameWork), however as time has gone on, this has become more and more out-of-date. With the release of PHP7, rather than combing through the code-base and updating things, my plan is to redesign the framework from the ground-up using newer features and tech.

### Disclaimer
This is a personal project, intended for use on other personal projects. I make no promises about the performance or reliability of the framework, however it is in my best interest to make it as solid as possible. If you find any issues or room for improvement, feel free to contribute.
