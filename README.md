## KrameWork7 - PHP7 Web Framework (WIP)

### What is this?
For a long time, sites I developed would be based on [KrameWork](https://github.com/Kruithne/KrameWork), however as time has gone on, this has become more and more out-of-date. With the release of PHP7, rather than combing through the code-base and updating things, my plan is to redesign the framework from the ground-up using newer features and tech.

### It's not very frameworky..
Rather than following the previous version of [KrameWork](https://github.com/Kruithne/KrameWork) in trying to be a framework, KW7 acts more like a toolkit. If you're quickly trying to spin up a script or mini-site, and you want the functionality of auto-loading provided by KW7, you can simply create a new `AutoLoader` instance and you're good to go, no need to fiddle about with framework configurations, dependencies or bootstraps. 

### Disclaimer
This is a personal project, intended for use on other personal projects. I make no promises about the performance or reliability of the framework, however it is in my best interest to make it as solid as possible. If you find any issues or room for improvement, feel free to contribute.
